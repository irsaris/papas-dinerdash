### PROJECT INFORMATION
This is a C++ interactive program that simulates the popular game Diner Dash.  
This program has various functionalities of the original Diner Dash game. We  
additionally implemented three features to our program. The first one is that  
by pressing ‘m’, your score will be incremented by 5, that way you can finish  
the game quickly. The second one is that both end screens, be it the loser or  
winner, have the option to restart the game. The winner screen is by simply  
pressing the space bar, and the loser screen is by using your arrow keys and  
locking in your choice with the enter key. For the final feature we added an  
extra ingredient, ketchup, to the burger, as well as implemented all the  
requirements for its functionality like its own station and item pick-up.
